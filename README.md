# SDSC2022 NYC - Databricks Workshop

> We presented this "Building a Flexible Geospatial Lakehouse on the Databricks Platform" material to workshop attendees at CARTO's 2022 [Spatial Data Science Conference](https://spatial-data-science-conference.com/2022/newyork/#workshops) in NYC. See Overview Notebook to get started. 

1. You can bring that into your Databricks environment through [Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html) integration with GitHub. 
2. In addition to using Databricks platform, this material also uses Databricks Labs Mosaic project [[docs](https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/index.html) | [repo](https://github.com/databrickslabs/mosaic) | [announcement blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/05/02/high-scale-geospatial-processing-with-mosaic.html)].
